### Loading Sidebar

Click "Show Sidebar" in the appearing Menu for Peer-Grading Tool.

### Loading template

If you have no existing template, run the script ones, by scrolling down in the sidebar and clicking "Run Sheet Generation". The script will load a template and stop execution.

### Fill in Students

Now you can fill in the Gmail Adresses of the user which should rate each other. The Gmail accounts are needed, so that every student can only edit his or her document. You will find it helpful if students use Gmail Adresses with their names. If you need more rows, just add the additional Gmail addresses in the same col.

### Fill in Competences and Weightings

Just replace the competences in the Template with the competences you want to have. Under each competence you can type in an multiplicator to make the impact of the competence higher.

If you need more competences, add additional columns. But be sure to adopt "Col last competence" in the sidebar.

### Make the sheet ready for Peer Grading process

Now you only have to click "Run Sheet Generation". This will generate a sheet for every student.

### Share the sheet with your Students

Copy the link in the browser or click "Share" and get the link there. You don't have to change permissions. All is done by the script! Send the link per e-mail, Google Classroom or similar to your students.

The students have to be logged in with the accounts which you filled in in the template-sheet. If they do so, they can edit the sheet with their username. They are only allowed to set points in the range which you defined in the sidebar.
