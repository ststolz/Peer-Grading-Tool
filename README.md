# About

**Peer-Grading Tool** is a plugin for *Google Spreadsheets*. It is intended for educational use cases where students should grade each other.

All you need are the Gmail Addresses (Google Users) of your students. Then *Peer-Grading Tool* creates a sheet for each stundent which is protected from other users. There students can rate work of their attendees (e.g. a presentation).

You have several options for configuration of this process. This include:

* **Skills** which are rated
* **Weighting** of every Skill
* **Rating Points** - Min and Max points students can use for Rating

# Why do I need this plugin

Teachers should give students the chance to assess work of others. This is an important part of the reflection process. In usual class sizes this is hardly possible because of time limitations. This is where *Peer-Grading Tool* comes into play and helps making it possible.

Provided you - the teacher - have a list of Gmail Addresses of your students, you are one klick away to automate this process:

1. One sheet for every student is created - no matter how many they are.
2. For every sheet only the owner of this sheet has the permissions to edit. The edit permissions are restricted to the desired area so that there is no chance to damage something.
3. An evaluation sheet is automatically created, where every student is listed with all ratings and the average of all ratings is automatically calculated.
